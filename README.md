# Tamagotcha
A small device designed to let you find each other in mixed reality.

## How I Built
 I set up a Unity Project using de-panther's WebXR Export plugin and uploaded it on Firebase. Then I set up the hardware using the Singularity project. After that, I anchored assets to each individual hardware node and enabled multiplayer.
