# Tamagotcha
A small device designed to let you find each other in mixed reality.

## How I Built
 I set up a Unity Project using de-panther's WebXR Export plugin and uploaded it on Firebase. Then I set up the hardware using the Singularity project. After that, I anchored assets to each individual hardware node and enabled multiplayer.

 ### Unity Setup
 Followed instructions here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wQG8_pb3cs&ab_channel=OrenDe-Panther

 ### Firebase Setup
 Ensure NPM is installed on your machine: https://nodejs.org/en/download/ 

 Then, using a Google account of your choice
 - Create a new Firebase project (optionally, enable Google Analytics)
 - Once created, navigate to Build on the Sidebar and select Hosting
 - Click Get Started and setup Firebase via NPM on your local environment as it guides you to do: I do this step in VSCode
 - Once Firebase is deployed and running (the terminal will provide you the live link), you can copy and paste the Unity build into the public folder and redeploy
